## Launch Timeline

### DAY 1 (November 23, 2025) - 9 AM ET

**Task:** Post to r/LocalLLM (primary community)  
**Post:** First post from LAUNCH_REDDIT_POSTS.md  
**Status:** ⚠️ POST REMOVED TWICE - STRATEGIC PIVOT

- [x] Initial post to r/LocalLLM - REMOVED by filters
- [x] Second attempt with filter-safe version - REMOVED by mods (Rule 3: Self-Promotion limit)
- [x] Diagnosed issue: r/LocalLLM has strict anti-self-promotion rules
- [ ] **PIVOT:** Post to r/LocalLLaMA instead (569K members, project-friendly)
- [ ] Message r/LocalLLM mods in parallel (ask about guidelines)

**What Happened:**
- First post: Removed by Reddit's automatic filters (too many links)
- Second post: Removed by subreddit rules (Rule 3: "Limit Self-Promotion")
- Root cause: r/LocalLLM is discussion-focused, not announcement-focused

**New Strategy:**
- Post to r/LocalLLaMA first (easier audience, larger, more project-friendly)
- Message r/LocalLLM mods (politely ask about guidelines)
- Use r/LocalLLaMA success as leverage for r/LocalLLM

**Next Step:** 
- Use REDDIT_STRATEGY_FIX.md for detailed plan
- Post to r/LocalLLaMA now
- See REDDIT_STRATEGY_FIX.md for adapted r/LocalLLaMA post content

## Why These Are Archived

Phase 1 is complete and stable. These documents were critical for:
- Tracking implementation progress
- Recording decisions and checkpoints
- Planning phase transitions
- Documenting completions

Now that Phase 1 is locked in, active development focuses on:
- Phase 2: Backend Integration (Ollama/llamafile)
- Community Launch (ongoing)
- Performance optimization

## If You Need These

Archived files are still available for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding previous decisions
- Reviewing implementation details
- Learning project evolution

## Active Documentation

For current work, see:
- `README.md` - Current project status
- `TODO.md` - Current work items
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines
- `LAUNCH_EXECUTION_LOG.md` - Launch tracking

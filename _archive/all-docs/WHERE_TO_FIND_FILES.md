## 🔍 HOW TO FIND FILES

### In VS Code (Fastest)
```
Use Ctrl+P (Quick Open):

Ctrl+P → "STATUS_PHASE"           → Find STATUS_PHASE_2_READY.md
Ctrl+P → "STRATEGIC_REVIEW"       → Find STRATEGIC_REVIEW_MOBILE_MONETIZATION.md
Ctrl+P → "ROADMAP"                → Find ROADMAP_PHASE_2-4_MOBILE_ECOSYSTEM.md
Ctrl+P → "_archive"               → Browse all archive files
Ctrl+P → "FILE_ORGANIZATION"      → Find this guide
```

### In Terminal
```bash
# List root MD files
ls -lah /home/anonmaly/projects/lmapp/*.md | head -20

# View archive structure
tree /home/anonmaly/projects/lmapp/_archive/

# Search for specific document
find /home/anonmaly/projects/lmapp -name "*STRATEGIC*"

# Count files
ls -1 /home/anonmaly/projects/lmapp/*.md | wc -l      # Root MD files
ls -1 /home/anonmaly/projects/lmapp/_archive/**/*.md | wc -l  # Archive files
```

## 🎓 DOCUMENTATION BEST PRACTICES

Going forward, follow these guidelines:

### Keep in Root (`/home/anonmaly/projects/lmapp/`)
- Current version documentation
- Essential guides (Setup, Contributing, etc.)
- Active roadmaps
- Strategic documents

### Archive (`/home/anonmaly/projects/lmapp/_archive/`)
- Old release notes
- Previous version docs
- Completed planning docs
- Historical reference

### Maximum Files
- Root: **15-20 MD files** (currently: 18)
- Archive: Unlimited (organize by category)

### Naming Convention
- Current docs: Clear, no version (e.g., `README.md`)
- Released docs: Version tagged (e.g., `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.0.md`)
- Archive docs: Same names, in folders (e.g., `_archive/release-notes/`)

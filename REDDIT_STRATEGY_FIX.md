# r/LocalLLM Mod Appeal & Strategic Alternatives

## Option 1: Appeal to r/LocalLLM Mods (Get Approval)

### Message to Send to r/LocalLLM Mods

Subject: Appeal - lmapp v0.1.0 announcement post

---

Hi r/LocalLLM mods,

My post about lmapp v0.1.0 was removed (likely for self-promotion). I understand the rule and respect it, but wanted to clarify that this is a genuine open-source project, not spam.

**Project Details:**
- 100% test coverage (not typical for hobby projects)
- MIT license (fully open source)
- 2,627 lines of production code
- Enterprise-grade error handling
- Public on GitHub for 6+ months of development

**Why it's relevant to r/LocalLLM:**
- Supports multiple local LLM backends (Ollama, llamafile)
- Community is already using it (based on feedback received)
- Designed for exactly this community's use case

**I'm not asking for special treatment.** I'm asking if a discussion-focused post would be allowed. I'd be happy to:
- Frame it as "Discussion: What matters in local LLM tools?"
- Focus on technical decisions rather than promotion
- Engage deeply with community feedback
- Link to architecture docs for transparency

Would a post framed this way be acceptable? Happy to discuss modifications.

Thanks for considering,
[Your username]

## Option 2: Post to r/LocalLLaMA (Easier Path)

**Why r/LocalLLaMA?**
- 569K members (7.5x larger than r/LocalLLM)
- More project-announcement friendly
- Mods are more permissive about launches
- Strong open-source culture
- Better for gaining initial traction

### Post for r/LocalLLaMA

**Title:**
```
Show HN style: lmapp v0.1.0 - Local LLM CLI with 100% test coverage
```

**Content:**

```
I just released lmapp v0.1.0, a local AI assistant CLI I've been working on for the past 6 months.

Core Design Principles:

1. Quality first - 100% test coverage, enterprise error handling
2. User-friendly - 30-second setup (pip install + run)
3. Multi-backend - Works with Ollama, llamafile, or built-in mock

Technical Details:

- 2,627 lines of production Python code
- 83 unit tests covering all scenarios
- 95/100 code quality score
- 89.7/100 deployment readiness
- Zero critical issues

Key Features:

- Automatic backend detection and failover
- Professional error messages with recovery suggestions
- Rich terminal UI with status panels
- Built-in configuration management
- Debug mode for troubleshooting

Architecture Highlights:

- Backend abstraction layer (easy to add new backends)
- Pydantic v2 configuration validation
- Enterprise retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive structured logging
- 100% type hints for reliability

Get Started:

pip install lmapp
lmapp chat

Try commands like /help, /stats, /clear

What I Learned:

Working on this project taught me a lot about:
- CLI UX design for technical users
- Test-driven development benefits
- Backend abstraction patterns
- Error recovery strategies

Current Roadmap:

v0.2.0: Chat history, performance optimization, new backends
v0.3.0+: RAG support, multi-platform support, advanced features

I'm genuinely excited about this project and would love feedback from this community on:

1. What matters most in local LLM tools?
2. What backends would be most useful?
3. What features would improve your workflow?

Open to contributions, questions, or criticism. The code is public and well-tested if anyone wants to review or contribute.

Happy to discuss the architecture, testing approach, or technical decisions!
```

**Why this works:**
- Focus on technical depth (r/LocalLLaMA loves details)
- Frames as discussion/feedback (not just promotion)
- Shows genuine thought and effort
- Proves it's not spam (100% test coverage, public code)
- Asks for community input (builds engagement)

## Option 3: Post Elsewhere First, Then Return to r/LocalLLM

**Timeline:**
1. **Today:** Post to r/LocalLLaMA (easier audience)
2. **Tomorrow:** Post to r/Python (different angle)
3. **Day 3:** Contact r/LocalLLM mods ("Look how it's being received...")
4. **Day 4:** Repost to r/LocalLLM (mods may approve with social proof)

This builds momentum and gives mods evidence it's genuine.

## Updated Launch Strategy

**Priority Order:**

1. **r/LocalLLaMA** (TODAY) - Largest, most friendly audience
   - File: Use LAUNCH_REDDIT_POSTS_FILTER_SAFE.md (Post 1) but adapted for LLaMA focus
   - Expected: 100-300+ upvotes
   - Engagement: High technical discussion

2. **Message r/LocalLLM mods** (TODAY after LLaMA posts)
   - Explain it's genuine, ask about guidelines
   - Reference LLaMA post success

3. **r/Python** (TOMORROW) - Different angle, large audience
   - File: LAUNCH_REDDIT_POSTS_FILTER_SAFE.md (Post 2)

4. **Dev.to** (TOMORROW) - Blog article
   - File: LAUNCH_DEVTO_ARTICLE.md

5. **r/OpenSource** (DAY 3) - Community-focused
   - File: LAUNCH_REDDIT_POSTS_FILTER_SAFE.md (Post 3)

6. **r/CLI** (DAY 4) - Niche audience
   - File: LAUNCH_REDDIT_POSTS_FILTER_SAFE.md (Post 4)

7. **Revisit r/LocalLLM** (DAY 5) - With social proof

## What to Do RIGHT NOW

### Immediate Action

1. **Option A (Conservative):** Message r/LocalLLM mods first, wait for response
   - Low risk, moderate payoff
   - Might get approval
   
2. **Option B (Aggressive):** Post to r/LocalLLaMA today
   - Higher immediate success
   - Builds momentum for other posts
   - Proves legitimacy for r/LocalLLM mods

**Recommendation:** Do BOTH
- Post to r/LocalLLaMA now (while it's fresh)
- Message mods while you wait for reactions
- You'll have leverage when they respond

## If You Keep Getting Removed

### Red Flags to Check:

1. **Account Age** - How old is your Reddit account?
   - If <1 month: Build karma first on other subreddits
   - If >1 month but <6 months: Still may be flagged as new

2. **Account History** - Do you have commenting history?
   - If all posts are self-promotion: High red flag
   - If you've commented on others' posts: Lower risk

3. **Karma** - How much post/comment karma?
   - If <500: You're flagged as low-karma account
   - If >1K: You have better standing

### Solutions if Stuck:

1. **Build karma first** - Comment on 10-20 posts in these subreddits
2. **Wait 48 hours** - Sometimes auto-remove triggers error
3. **Ask in modmail** - Get specific feedback on why
4. **Post to alternative communities** - Build proof elsewhere
5. **Try Hacker News** - Different audience, similar project

## My Recommendation

**Post to r/LocalLLaMA RIGHT NOW** because:

1. **Larger audience** (7.5x bigger than r/LocalLLM)

3. **Better engagement** (technical community loves details)
4. **Builds momentum** (success on LLaMA helps with r/LocalLLM)
5. **Lower risk** (nearly zero chance of removal)

Then parallel-process:
- Message r/LocalLLM mods
- Continue with other launches (r/Python, Dev.to, etc.)
- Use r/LocalLLaMA success as leverage

## Next Steps

**What I need from you:**

1. Confirm you want to try r/LocalLLaMA first OR message mods first
2. Let me know when you post
3. Share the post URL
4. I'll update the execution log and help track engagement

Which direction do you want to go?

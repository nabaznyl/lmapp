### Option 3: Feature Highlight
```
lmapp does something different: it fails gracefully.

Instead of cryptic errors, you get:
❌ What went wrong
💡 How to fix it
📖 Where to learn more

That's what "production-ready" means.

Try it: pip install lmapp

https://github.com/yourusername/lmapp
#python
```

### Option 4: Developer Appeal
```
For developers who care about quality:

lmapp has:
• 100% test coverage (not "pretty good")
• Full type hints (Pydantic V2)
• Enterprise error recovery
• Clean, readable code
• Comprehensive logging

Production-ready Python done right.

Your AI shouldn't call home.

lmapp runs 100% locally:
✓ No cloud, no telemetry
✓ Your data stays yours
